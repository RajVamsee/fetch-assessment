## üìù Introduction

This exercise is a **Receipt Processor API**, where users can submit receipts and earn points based on certain rules. The API processes receipts, assigns them a unique ID, calculates points, and returns them.

The application is built using **Python & Flask**, ensuring a robust, scalable, and lightweight RESTful API. Unit tests are included to verify all endpoints and validation checks.

## üéØ Rules for Awarding Points

These rules collectively define how many points should be awarded to a receipt:

- **1Ô∏è‚É£ One point** for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.  
- **2Ô∏è‚É£ 50 points** if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.  
- **3Ô∏è‚É£ 25 points** if the total is a multiple of `0.25`.  
- **4Ô∏è‚É£ 5 points** for every two items on the receipt.  
- **5Ô∏è‚É£ If the trimmed length** of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by `0.2` and round up to the nearest integer.  
- **6Ô∏è‚É£ 6 points** if the day in the purchase date is odd.  
- **7Ô∏è‚É£ 10 points** if the time of purchase is after 2:00 PM and before 4:00 PM.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the Repository**
Run the following command to **clone the project** to your local system:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RajVamsee/fetch-assessment.git
cd FETCH-ASSESSMENT
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

#### **For Windows:**
```sh
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
```
#### **For Mac/Linux:**
```sh
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
To deactivate the virtual environment at any time, use:
```sh
deactivate
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Install dependencies**

Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed. Then, install the required dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the Application Locally**
To start the Flask application locally, run:
```sh
python app.py
```
The application will start on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Run Tests**
  
To verify the API and its functionalities, run the test suite using:
```sh
pytest test_app.py
```
If all test cases pass, you will see an output indicating 16 passed test cases.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the Application using Docker**
To containerize and run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

Step 1 : Build the Docker Image
Run the following command to create a Docker image:
```sh
docker build -t fetch-receipt-processor .
```
Step 2 : Run the Docker Container
Once the image is built, start a container using:
```sh
docker run -p 5000:5000 fetch-receipt-processor
```
The application should now be accessible at:

- http://127.0.0.1:5000/
- http://localhost:5000/
